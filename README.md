# Hi there 👋
- 🧑 I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on spatiotemporal modeling (multivariate time series analysis) and generative model, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection. These works are mainly applied in the fields of transportation and energy.
- 👯 I'm working at McGill University in Canada as a visiting Ph.D.

#### Books are the ladder of human progress, while open source is the elevator. 
I support open source and advocate for reproducible research.
